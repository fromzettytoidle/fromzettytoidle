                            <p class="text-left">Hello to my favourite 아이들! Firtsly, congratulations on a very successful comeback 🥳👏🏻😍🤩 I NEVER DIE is insanely fantastic thanks to everyone involved who worked very hard 👏🏻💯
                              It has only been around 1 year & 3 months that I first discovered this amazing group of artists.
                              The funny story of discovering you guys is that i actually stumbled upon a funny video compilation on youtube.
                              After having lots of laugh during one of my difficult times dealing with studies & personal problems, I eventually
                              started to explore your music (I successfully graduated & somehow managed to get best student award 😊 Thank you for being my happy pills when i needed it so much 💐💜).
                              아이들 is truly made of amazing, hard working and talented group of people is what i thought of then & now & forever. By then, I know i'm gonna be a forever fan 💜 It's a pity i wasn't a part of your journey
                              from the start but i'm still grateful that we have crossed path. There are many things that makes up my happiness & 아이들 is a
                              huge part of that.  While the group is on hiatus last year, i made time to explore lots of things such as past performances & show appearances.
                              It is amazing to witness how all of you grow each release. It's so inspiring to see you guys being so passionate in whatever you are doing.
                              Thank you for always working hard on & off stage. The success you have achieved so far are very well deserved. All of you deserves much more happiness & success.
                              I'll always be here to support all of you & i'll always be forever grateful & proud to be a neverland 💜💜💜💜💜💜
                              Let's be happy & healthy always! 😋 Sending my love from Malaysia to all of you 💐💌 I hope you'll have a concert here someday (maybe soon 👀🤞🏻) and i hope i can be there to meet you guys 🥰

                                  you had the most schedules and also make time to meet neverland in VLIVE. All those schedule really made my days happier.
                                  I really enjoyed watching you host 소문의 아이들, MCountdown, 별에서 온 퀴즈, your acting in Replay, Delivery, Adult Trainee.
                                  The songs you released or featured in were amazing as well. I really love your voice and also performances! I'll be waiting for
                                  you to showcase more of your singing, acting, hosting and everything you do 🥰 One of the thing i'm always looking forward to is your VLIVE! Just you having fun
                                  talking to us, singing, dancing & doing whatever you want is always a good time. Thank you miyeon for always working hard, treating us very well & bringing smiles to all of us. I hope you are happy
                                  too instead of just making others happy 💖 Being your fan is a blessing to me and it's something i'm proud of.
                                  I hope we'll be together for a very long time. Do stay healthy and happy always. You are truly a great person so just stay the way you are 💚 I cannot wait for the day to see you on stage in person whether in Malaysia or South Korea or anywhere in the world.

                            every single time. Your singing in Lee Mujin Service was insane! I really enjoyed it. The songs that you produced/written always hits something in me. Those songs
                            are the kind that really takes you somewhere else when listening to it. Thank you for sharing your talent and music to the world 🌻 I really miss your vlive session 😿 I'm still
                            waiting for another session of you casually singing while playing the piano 😍 Oh, i love your acting in So Not Worth It! I had fun binge-watching the series. In Mindset you encouraged others to dream bigger and i hope i can do that.
                            For me who really lacks self-believe i don't have many dreams cause i'm always uncertain bout things. I'm gonna try to follow your advice & see where it brings me. I'll work hard just like
                            all of you too. Thank you for always doing your best on & off stage & always loving neverland 💓 Stay the way you are cause you are such a great person 😊 I look forward to the day I'll attend 아이들's concert and if we meet each other let's hang out and let me treat you some delicious
                            meal 🤞🏻 I love you! 💌

                            no matter in creating a song, performing, apearing in variety/talk shows & whatever you do 🖤 (I miss watching you having the time of your life in Learnway!) While you always
                            make others happy, i hope you are too (Don't be often too angry like when you write LIAR please. LIAR is amazing but i pray you won't be angry too frequently). You deserves all the happiness the world could offer. Just like you,
                            I hope i can make you & others happy too 😊 The songs that you have made and released are all amazing. Even my 3-years old niece are obsessed with Giant after i let her join me streaming the MV & because of her blasting it
                            frequently now the whole family knows you 🤣👏🏻💝. Congratulations for releasing another 2 amazing songs! I'm excited that more songs keep coming from you 🙌🏻 The way you wrote the lyrics for Polaroid makes me want to cherish each photo even more (& now i want to buy Polaroid even more 😯). I also like the song covers you do.
                            I love your vocals & performances!
                            With the talent that all of you are bringing to the world and the hard work that you guys always put in, i hope you & the group will receive lots more success in the future 🙏🏻 But most importantly i want you guys to be happy and healthy 🥰 I'm always here
                            to support you all the time. I hope we can meet soon & if we meet anywhere outside the event venue, i'll treat you a meal. I love you 💌
